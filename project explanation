Number Guessing Game in Java

📋 Objective:
To create an interactive command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess to help the player find the correct number.

🧱 Core Components:
1. Class: GuessingGame
Encapsulates all the logic for the game.

Fields:
int randomNumber – Stores the number randomly generated by the computer.

int attempts – Tracks how many guesses the user has made.

Scanner scanner – Captures user input from the console.

Constructor:
Uses the Random class to generate a number between 1 and 100.

Initializes attempts to 0.

Initializes the Scanner for input.

2. Method: play()
Runs the game loop:

Welcomes the user.

Prompts them to guess a number.

Gives hints like “Too high!” or “Too low!”.

Increments the attempts after each guess.

Ends when the correct number is guessed.

Displays the total number of attempts.

🔁 Game Flow (Logic):
Start game → Show welcome message.

Generate random number.

Prompt user to guess.

Compare user guess:

If too high → print message.

If too low → print message.

If correct → congratulate and end game.

Track the number of attempts.

🧠 Concepts Used:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

User input (Scanner)

Loops (while)

Conditionals (if-else)

Random number generation (Random)

✅ Learning Outcomes:
Basic Java syntax and structure

Creating classes and objects

Handling user input

Writing loops and conditionals

Encapsulation and method abstraction
