Your Java console Number Guessing Game already includes solid client-side data validation with these features:

.It validates that user inputs are integers.

.It checks that the inputs fall within valid ranges (e.g., difficulty choices 1-3, guesses within 1 to maxNumber).

.It handles invalid input types gracefully using try-catch (InputMismatchException).

.It reprompts users until valid input is entered.

*About Client-side and Server-side Validation:
.Client-side validation is typically done in UI or front-end to give instant feedback and reduce invalid requests to the backend.

.Server-side validation occurs on the backend (server) to ensure data integrity and security, regardless of client input.

Since your game is a standalone console app, the distinction is less applicableâ€”there is no client-server architecture here.

*If you were to implement this game in a client-server environment, for example:
.Client side (e.g., GUI or web frontend):

-Validate inputs before sending to server (e.g., numeric, within range).

-Provide quick error messages to users.

.Server side (e.g., backend game service):

-Validate received inputs again to prevent invalid or malicious data.

-Enforce game logic securely.

Summary: For your current Java console game
Your getValidInt method is effectively the client-side validation step, preventing invalid data entry before game logic proceeds.

No server-side validation is needed unless you expand the architecture to a client-server model.
